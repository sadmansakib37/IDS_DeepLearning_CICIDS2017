# Analyzing Deep Learning Model Performance for Intrusion Detection on CIC-IDS2017 Dataset

This repository contains the research paper titled **"Analyzing Deep Learning Model Performance for Intrusion Detection on CIC-IDS2017 Dataset"** by Md. Sadman Sakib and Noshin Tabassum, published as part of our research.

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are vital for detecting and mitigating real-time cyber threats. This study leverages the CIC-IDS2017 dataset to evaluate the performance of deep learning modelsâ€”including MLP, 1D CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, DBN, and hybrid architecturesâ€”for both binary and multiclass intrusion classification tasks. Our findings show that deep learning significantly improves intrusion detection accuracy and reduces false positives compared to conventional machine learning models.
